# Student Management System (Spring Boot Project)

A full-stack web application built using **Spring Boot** that allows users to manage student records such as adding, updating, viewing, and deleting students.

This project demonstrates the implementation of **CRUD operations**, **MVC architecture**, and **database integration** using modern Java backend technologies.


## Project Overview

The Student Management System is designed to manage student information efficiently.  
Users can:

- Add new students
- View student list
- Edit student details
- Delete student records

This project helped me understand how real-world web applications are structured using Spring Boot.
